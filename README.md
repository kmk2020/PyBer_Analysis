As seen from the image above, total fare are highest in the urban cities, followed by suburban areas and lowest in rural cities.
This can be attributed to their relative cost of living and their relative ease of movement, the ease of move,ent is difficult diue to congestion and other factors while the cost of living is high hence making tyhe total fares high. The total fares for the city are high because people living in the urban city or in an urban city are more like;y to request for a ride than in the rural areas.

Rural citise have low tptal fares because people in rural cities propbably pay less fare due to the low cost of operating a ride share and lower cost of living.

Suburban cities have the total fares in the middle because of the balance of the above discussed factors.
* Total rides

Above table shows that total rides are highest in urban cities and lowest  in rural cities; 125 and 1625 respectively.
This could be due to urban cities having more users than rural cities. The othe reason could be nbecause urban cities seem to in most cases to have better road infrustructure compared to rural cities and suburban cities.
* Total drivers

As shown in the above image,there are more drivers in urban cities thasn in both rural cities and suburban cities. This could coreelated to te number of rides required in each type of city.

* Average fare per ride and the average per driver 
A driver in the urban cities makes an estimated average of $16.60 while tfhat in rural cities makes an estimated $55.50 ,this is a huge difference. Fares are cheaper in urban cities due to the availability of many rides but expensive ion rural cities due to rides being few.

The average fare per ride is highest in rural cities and lowest in urban areas. TYhis is due to the availability of many rides as compared to the lpow number of rides available in riural areas. 
# Summary
* Create bonuses for drivers who want to join in rural cities
* Offset the cost of rides in rural cities by offering coupons
* increase fares in urban cities
